# DSpace build.properties
# This file should be customised to suit your build environment.
# Note that not all configuration is handled here, only the most common
# properties that tend to differ between build environments. 
# For adjusting global settings or more complex settings, edit the relevant config file.
#
# IMPORTANT: Do not remove or comment out settings in build.properties
# When you edit the "build.properties" file (or a custom *.properties file),
# take care not to remove or comment out any settings. Doing so, may cause
# your final "dspace.cfg" file to be misconfigured with regards to that
# particular setting.  Instead, if you wish to remove/disable a particular
# setting, just clear out its value.  For example, if you don't want to be
# notified of new user registrations, ensure the "mail.registration.notify"
# setting has no value, e.g. "mail.registration.notify="

# Schema name - if your database contains multiple schemas, you can avoid
# problems with retrieving the definitions of duplicate object names by
# specifying the schema name that is used for DSpace.
# ORACLE USAGE NOTE: In Oracle, schema is equivalent to "username". This means

#                       mail.smtp.socketFactory.fallback=false

# An option is added to disable the mailserver. By default, this property is set to false
# By setting mail.server.disabled = true, DSpace will not send out emails.
# It will instead log the subject of the email which should have been sent
# This is especially useful for development and test environments where production data is used when testing functionality.
#mail.server.disabled = false

##### File Storage ######

# Asset (bitstream) store number 0 (zero)
assetstore.dir = ${dspace.dir}/assetstore

# Specify extra asset stores like this, counting from 1 upwards:
# assetstore.dir.1 = /second/assetstore
# assetstore.dir.2 = /third/assetstore

# Specify the number of the store to use for new bitstreams with this property
# The default is 0 (zero) which corresponds to the 'assetstore.dir' above
# assetstore.incoming = 1


##### SRB File Storage #####

# The same 'assetstore.incoming' property is used to support the use of SRB
# (Storage Resource Broker - see http://www.sdsc.edu/srb/) as an _optional_
# replacement of or supplement to conventional file storage. DSpace will work
# with or without SRB and full backward compatibility is maintained.
#
# The 'assetstore.incoming' property is an integer that references where _new_
# bitstreams will be stored.  The default (say the starting reference) is zero.
# The value will be used to identify the storage where all new bitstreams will
# be stored until this number is changed.  This number is stored in the
# Bitstream table (store_number column) in the DSpace database, so older
# bitstreams that may have been stored when 'asset.incoming' had a different
# value can be found.
#
# In the simple case in which DSpace uses local (or mounted) storage the
# number can refer to different directories (or partitions).  This gives DSpace
# some level of scalability.  The number links to another set of properties
# 'assetstore.dir', 'assetstore.dir.1' (remember zero is default),
# 'assetstore.dir.2', etc., where the values are directories.
#
# To support the use of SRB DSpace uses this same scheme but broadened to
# support:
# - using SRB instead of the local filesystem
# - using the local filesystem (native DSpace)
# - using a mix of SRB and local filesystem
#
# In this broadened use the 'asset.incoming' integer will refer one of the
# following storage locations
# - a local filesystem directory (native DSpace)
# - a set of SRB account parameters (host, port, zone, domain, username,
#       password, home directory, and resource)
#
# Should there be any conflict, like '2' refering to a local directory and
# to a set of SRB parameters, the program will select the local directory.
#
# If SRB is chosen from the first install of DSpace, it is suggested that
# 'assetstore.dir' (no integer appended) be retained to reference a local
# directory (as above under File Storage) because build.xml uses this value
# to do a mkdir. In this case, 'assetstore.incoming' can be set to 1 (i.e.
# uncomment the line in File Storage above) and the 'assetstore.dir' will not
# be used.
#
# Here is an example set of SRB parameters:
# Assetstore 1 - SRB
#srb.host.1 = mysrbmcathost.myu.edu
#srb.port.1 = 5544
#srb.mcatzone.1 = mysrbzone
#srb.mdasdomainname.1 = mysrbdomain
#srb.defaultstorageresource.1 = mydefaultsrbresource
#srb.username.1 = mysrbuser
#srb.password.1 = mysrbpassword
#srb.homedirectory.1 = /mysrbzone/home/mysrbuser.mysrbdomain
#srb.parentdir.1 = mysrbdspaceassetstore
#
# Assetstore n, n+1, ...
# Follow same pattern as for assetstores above (local or SRB)


##### Logging configuration #####

# Override default log4j configuration
# You may provide your own configuration here, existing alternatives are:
# log.init.config = ${dspace.dir}/config/log4j.xml
# log.init.config = ${dspace.dir}/config/log4j-console.properties
log.init.config = ${dspace.dir}/config/log4j.properties

# Where to put the logs (used in configuration only)
log.dir = ${dspace.dir}/log

# If enabled, the logging and the Solr statistics system will look for
# an X-Forwarded-For header. If it finds it, it will use this for the user IP address
#useProxies = true

##### DOI registration agency credentials ######
# To mint DOIs you have to use a DOI registration agency like DataCite. Several
# DataCite members offers services as DOI registration agency, so f.e. EZID or
# TIB Hannover. To mint DOIs with DSpace you have to get an agreement with an
# DOI registration agency. You have to edit 
# [dspace]/config/spring/api/identifier-service.xml and to configure the following
# properties.

# Credentials used to authenticate against the registration agency:
identifier.doi.user = username
identifier.doi.password = password
# DOI prefix used to mint DOIs. All DOIs minted by DSpace will use this prefix.
# The Prefix will be assigned by the registration agency.
identifier.doi.prefix = 10.5072
# If you want to, you can further separate your namespace. Should all the
# suffixes of all DOIs minted by DSpace start with a special string to separate
# it from other services also minting DOIs under your prefix?
identifier.doi.namespaceseparator = dspace/

##### Plugin management #####

# Where to look for third-party plugin packages.  The value is a colon-separated
# list of filesystem directories and/or JAR files:  a Java class path.  Plugin
# classes not found in the usual places will be sought in these places last.  If
# unset, only the standard places will be searched.
#plugin.classpath = ${dspace.dir}/plugins/aPlugin.jar

##### Search settings #####

# Where to put search index files
search.dir = ${dspace.dir}/search

# Higher values of search.max-clauses will enable prefix searches to work on
# large repositories
search.max-clauses = 2048

# Which Lucene Analyzer implementation to use.  If this is omitted or
# commented out, the standard DSpace analyzer (designed for English)
# is used by default.

# Non-Stemming analyzer.  Does not "stem" words/terms. When using this analyzer,
# a search for "wellness" will always return items matching "wellness" and not "well".
# However, similarly a search for "experiments" will only return objects matching 
# "experiments" and not "experiment" or "experimenting".
# search.analyzer = org.dspace.search.DSNonStemmingAnalyzer

# Chinese analyzer
# search.analyzer = org.apache.lucene.analysis.cn.ChineseAnalyzer

search.analyzer = org.apache.lucene.analysis.br.BrazilianAnalyzer

# Boolean search operator to use, current supported values are OR and AND
# If this config item is missing or commented out, OR is used
# AND requires all search terms to be present
# OR requires one or more search terms to be present
search.operator = OR

# Maximum number of terms indexed for a single field in Lucene.
# Default is 10,000 words - often not enough for full-text indexing.
# If you change this, you'll need to re-index for the change
# to take effect on previously added items.
# -1 = unlimited (Integer.MAX_VALUE)
search.maxfieldlength = 10000

##### Fields to Index for Search #####

# DC metadata elements.qualifiers to be indexed for search
# format: - search.index.[number] = [search field]:element.qualifier
#       - * used as wildcard
#	- inputform -> In case we have different input-forms for different repository supported locales (e.g input-forms_el.xml, input-forms_pt.xml etc). In this case, the 
#		stored and the displayed value from all input-forms are indexed. If the stored value is not found in input-forms, it is indexed anyway.
#		e.g.:search.index.12 = language:dc.language:inputform
#
###      changing these will change your search results,     ###

##### Handle settings ######

# Canonical Handle URL prefix
#
# By default, DSpace is configured to use http://hdl.handle.net/
# as the canonical URL prefix when generating dc.identifier.uri
# during submission, and in the 'identifier' displayed in JSPUI
# item record pages.
#
# If you do not subscribe to CNRI's handle service, you can change this
# to match the persistent URL service you use, or you can force DSpace
# to use your site's URL, eg.
#handle.canonical.prefix = ${dspace.url}/handle/
#
# Note that this will not alter dc.identifer.uri metadata for existing
# items (only for subsequent submissions), but it will alter the URL 
# in JSPUI's 'identifier' message on item record pages for existing items.
#
# If omitted, the canonical URL prefix will be http://hdl.handle.net/
handle.canonical.prefix = ${dspace.url}/handle/

# CNRI Handle prefix
